        # used stack overflow too help me set up the timer that displays top left
    # My father helped me figure out how to reset the timer every game run, also advised me to use variables that mean something

### THINGS TO DO ###
# 1. game is done, I have a starting screen and a goal and so and so
# 2. make a way to restart game (a loop, but where)
        # Completed this

# 3. add images, make the game a theme
# 4. make the mobs speed up and slow down
# 5. add a points leaderboard
